# Python Sandbox

This is an online python playground built with Javascript, Bulma css, Docker, and Python 3. Built to run on Ubuntu 18.04, but it'll run on anything, really.

## Setup

Run `setup.sh` to install dependencies (configured for Ubuntu 18.04), install flask and the python docker library in a virtual env, and then run `start.sh` to run in Flask debug mode. Use gunicorn or another WSGI server if you want to run in production.
